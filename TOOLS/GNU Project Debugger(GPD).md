## Introduction

GDB lets you see what's going on inside another program while it executes, or what a program was doing the moment it crashes.

GDB does four main things with optional support for these functions

- Start a program, specifying anything that might affect its behavior.
- Make a program stop on specified conditions.
- Examine what has happened, when a program has stopped
- Change things in a program, so you can experiment with correcting the effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.

### Supported Languages

- C++
